This project is a small VNFM to have Fortinet products (FortiGate) running with OpenBaton.

The project only contains a basic skeleton, with empty operations. But it should be valid to have the FortiGate running manually. Later, operations can be added to VNFM to fully automate operation.

In order to have this code working you need:

    - java 1.7 (if you have a higher version, please set compilation target to 1.7)
    - gradle 1.12 or above

Once the repo is cloned, just execute:

    gradle build wrapper

This will create the gradle wrapper that gets the proper version and setup. Next step is:

    ./gradlew clean build

Notice this is "gradlew" and not "gradle" as in previous command. This will create a jar that you can take it from:

    ./build/libs/fortinet-vnfm-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar

Ensure the jar is copied to the machine where OpenBaton is running (brokerIp for rabbitmq is set to localhost for this version) and then execute:

    java -jar fortinet-vnfm-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar

You will see Spring logs and the process will remain connected to OpenBaton via rabbitmq.

That's it.
